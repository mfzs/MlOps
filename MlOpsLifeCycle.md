- Machine Learning Life cycle is a process of developing and deploying machine learning models in production.

    - Problem Definition
    - Data Collection -- Take from the publicly available datasets like Kaggle, UCI, etc. or incase it is internal then data scientis gather the data.
    - Data Preprocessing -- Clean the data, handle missing values, outliers, etc.
    - Feature Engineering -- Create new features from the existing features.
    - Model Selection -- Algo selection. Select the best model for the problem.
    - Model Training -- Train the model using the preprocessed data.
    - Model Evaluation -- Evaluate the model using the test data.
    - Hyperparameter Tuning -- Tune the hyperparameters of the model.
    - Model Deployment -- Deploy the model in production.
    - Model Monitoring -- Monitor the model performance in production.
    - Model Retraining -- Retrain the model using the new data.
    - Model Versioning -- Version the model.
    - Model Maintenance -- Maintain the model in production.
